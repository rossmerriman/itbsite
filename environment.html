<div class="text"> The college has a 22 hectares (54 acres) campus within Fingal County Council's College Business and Technology Park, on Blanchardstown Road North. The component buildings, with a total area of over 22,000 square metres, and capital cost exceeding â‚¬50 million. The campus i locaion is historically known as Buzzardstown. Buzzardstown can be dated back to 1574 from owers documentaion. This land has since been devided up but the ecology and wild life remain the same. Many flora and fauna have been around long before ITB and still remain. From ecology landscape studies conducted by the Horticulture students we know over the last 40 years, farming has intensified to meet production demands meaning most of the wildflower meadows have been lost. We also know that due to the wild grass growing tall provids shelter to local species. This means the land around campus has been home to many different life forms for many many years and continue to. The camous has a wide range of terain such as, grasslands, wet grasslands and scrublands. These are remains from before the campus was ever an idea and gives us a great idea of what the area looked like fore the campus was build. Now that we have the campus is displays great modern progression of education buildings while keeping the important elements of ecology from many years ago side by side.
