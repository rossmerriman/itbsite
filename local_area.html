<div class="text"> Back When ITB first opened the local area was already well astablished with many residence, shops, schools, community centres and connencting roads, but it was certanly come a long way and developed strongly along the way. Blanchardstown shopping centre was well up and runnig with many shops such as Dunnes stores, PC World and Roches Stores. Many more shops have found home here such as Super Dry, Carphone Warehouse, JD Sport and Gamestop. They have also added many places to eat such as Mcdonalds. Burger king and Nandos. The whole shoping centre is alwasy evolving and expanding adding to the development and moderization of the local area. The National Aquatic Centre is alsoright down the road from ITB. The Aquatic Centre was build in 2001 and has operated since. This and the shopping centre has added a lot of business and jobs to the local area as well as attracting the eye of many and giving BLanchardstown a spot on the map. With the increasing population of the area many more housing estates have been built and transportaion has imporved a lot. Transportation to Blanchardstown has many links to locations to the City Centre and far away towns thanks to better bus routes and a better schedual of them. The near by train system also allows for easy travil. These imporoved transportation links have allowed many people to move to Blanchardstown as it means they can still visit family far away and can access jobs not located in Blanchardstown. All of these developments have allowed for ITB to dvelop at a very quick rate which adds to the betterment of the area as a whole.
